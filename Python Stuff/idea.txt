The idea is that i make a program that runs descretly in the background of any computer running the function and storing all the numbers that dont work it would go through every number
until it found a number that does work and it would then notify when it finds a number that doesnt go with the conjecture. 

honestly not even that complicated. the program I can get written in a short time and I would just make a website for the people to download the program from

I could make it incentivised, so the first person to find a working number wins something idk what. that way people would have a reason to download the program and actually use it

make the code completly open source so people can look at it and know that its not some virus thats gonna kill them


Also instead of random numbers each time, for efficantcy, it could be starting at 2 counting up 1 each time, that would take a long time to get to the numbers that havent been tested, 
but maybe we dont start at 2 like maybe we start a lot higher or something idk that would require math to see how long it might take to get the from 2 to the likely numbers.

Database would likely be in MongoDB

Im gonna work on this more after work, but this is a good start, i mean i could dist this but there wouldnt be any tracking of numbers so...
